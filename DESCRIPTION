Title: Mass Balance Reconstruction
Version: 0.0.1
Author: Hung Nguyen
Maintainer: Hung Nguyen <ntthung@gmail.com>
Description: Mass-balance-adjusted Regression algorithm for streamflow reconstruction at sub-annual resolution (e.g., seasonal or monthly). The algorithm implements a penalty term to minimize the differences between the total sub-annual flows and the annual flow. The method is described in Nguyen et al (2020) <DOI: 10.1002/essoar.10504791.1>.
